# 4-bit-Up-Down-Counter-in-Verilog
An up-down counter is capable of counting in both incremental and decremental fashion. 
For a 4-bit synchronous up-down counter, we need four flip-flops, with the same clock and reset inputs.
The way to achieve the ability to count in both directions is by combining the designs for the up and the down counters and using a switch to alternate between them. 
Multiplexers give you the option of choosing between multiple inputs. So, it does an excellent job of being a switch in digital electronics.
